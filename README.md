# Multispectral Fusion Detection Algorithm and Hardware Imple

## Beginning
Together with Bot Huang and Mengjia Dai, We plan to complete College Students' Innovation Projects with the help of the SOC Lab server(Xi Jin,USTC).

## GOAL
This project combines the advantages of thermal radiation information in infrared images and detailed texture information in visible images, uses deep learning and target detection algorithm design, optimizes and accelerates at the hardware level, and finally deploys it on FPGA to achieve accurate target detection.
